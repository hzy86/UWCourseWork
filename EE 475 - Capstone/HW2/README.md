P1 - alarm circuit
P2 - given a 6-bit input, return whether it's a multiple of 3 or 5
P3 - testbench for P2 to compare all possible input combination against results computed by the
     simulator using its own arithmetic.
P4 - use an OR gate and a BUT gate to realize F=W, X, Y, Z(5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14)
